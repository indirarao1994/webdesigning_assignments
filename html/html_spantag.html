<p>
The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container 
for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent 
anything. It can be used to group elements for styling 
purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they 
share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only
 when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is 
very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level 
element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.

<p>Add the 
<span class="ingredient">basil</span>,
<span class="ingredient">pine nuts</span> 
and 
<span class="ingredient">garlic</span> 
to a blender and blend into a paste.</p>

<p>Gradually add the 
<span class="ingredient">olive oil</span>
 while running the blender slowly.</p>
